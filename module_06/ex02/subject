Create a class Base that only possesses a public virtual destructor. Create three
empty classes A, B and C that publicly inherit from Base.
Write a function "Base * generate(void);" that randomly instanciates A, B or C
and returns the instance as a Base pointer. Feel free to use anything you like for the
randomness.
Write a function "void identify_from_pointer(Base * p);" that displays "A",
"B" or "C" according to the real type of p.
Write a function "void identify_from_reference( Base & p);" that displays "A",
"B" or "C" according to the real type of p.
Wrap these three functions in a program that prooves that everything works as intended. Including <typeinfo> is forbidden.
